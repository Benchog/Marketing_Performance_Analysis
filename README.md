# 📊 Marketing Performance Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

> **Executive Summary**
> This project analyzes the performance of a 2021 marketing campaign run by five companies across five major U.S. cities. Using Excel, the goal was to translate complex marketing data into **clear, simple insights** that anyone — even without a data background — can understand and act on.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The core question behind this analysis was simple:

**Was the marketing campaign truly worth it?**

To answer this, the project examines the full marketing funnel — from ad exposure to clicks, conversions, cost, and returns — and highlights where value was created and where it was lost.
